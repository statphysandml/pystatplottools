pystatplottools
=================

The pystatplottools library simplifies plotting and evaluating high-dimensional distributions. Further, it provides an interface to load data from mulitple text files and enables the generation of a pytorch dataloader for the data. The library is used by the MCMCSimulationLib and the LatticeModelImplementation project.
